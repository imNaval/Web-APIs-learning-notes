## What are Web APIs?

Web APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are powerful tools provided by browsers that allow developers to interact with and manipulate the browser, the device, and the web itself. They enable you to build rich, interactive, and modern web applications by providing access to features like:

- The Document Object Model (DOM)
- Fetching data from servers (Fetch API, XMLHttpRequest)
- Storing data locally (Web Storage, IndexedDB)
- Accessing device hardware (Geolocation, Camera, Microphone)
- Real-time communication (WebSockets, WebRTC)
- Graphics and multimedia (Canvas, Web Audio, WebGL)
- Notifications, Clipboard, and much more!

## Why Learn Web APIs?

- **Essential for Frontend Development:** Mastery of Web APIs is crucial for building dynamic, user-friendly web apps.
- **Interview-Ready:** Many frontend interviews focus on your understanding of core browser APIs and how to use them effectively.
- **Unlock Modern Features:** Web APIs let you create experiences that feel native and powerful, right in the browser.
